# Fullstack Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains projects, exercises, and examples that I worked on during my journey to become a Fullstack Developer. The projects span both front-end and back-end technologies, covering various concepts like HTML/CSS, JavaScript frameworks, server-side programming, databases, and even some cloud deployment. These projects document my progress in building complete web applications from scratch, showcasing everything from static web pages to dynamic, data-driven web applications.

## Projects

1. **HTML & CSS Basics**:  
   Learning the foundational elements of the web. This includes projects that helped me understand the structure and styling of web pages, such as:
   - A personal portfolio page.
   - Several small websites showcasing layouts, responsiveness, and CSS grid/flexbox.

2. **JavaScript Fundamentals**:  
   Projects focused on learning the basics of JavaScript, including:
   - DOM manipulation exercises.
   - Simple interactive features like image sliders, form validation, and to-do lists.
   - Building a simple game using JavaScript to understand event handling.

3. **React & Front-End Frameworks**:  
   - **React To-Do List App**: A simple to-do list built with React, which helped me get familiar with React components, hooks, and state management.
   - **Weather App**: A weather forecasting app using an open weather API and React. Practiced API consumption, handling asynchronous data, and displaying it in an intuitive UI.
   - **Vue.js Practice**: Experiments using Vue.js to learn the differences and similarities compared to React, including smaller components and a CRUD interface for managing items.

4. **Back-End Development with Node.js and Express**:  
   - **RESTful API**: Created a RESTful API with Express.js that handled basic CRUD operations for an inventory management system.
   - **Authentication System**: Developed a basic user authentication system including registration, login, and password encryption using bcrypt and JWT (JSON Web Token).

5. **Databases & SQL**:  
   - **SQL Projects**: Practiced fundamental SQL operations with SQLite and MySQL, including creating tables, performing complex joins, and optimizing queries.
   - **MongoDB**: Implemented a NoSQL database in a MERN stack application to manage user data. Practiced using Mongoose to create models and schemas.

6. **Fullstack Projects**:  
   - **Blog Application**: A complete blog application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This project involved building both front-end and back-end, user authentication, CRUD operations, and user interfaces with React.
   - **E-commerce Platform**: Developed a simple e-commerce web application where users could browse products, add them to a cart, and checkout. Used React for the front-end and Express/MongoDB for the back-end. Learned about state management, user sessions, and payment integration.

7. **Deployment & DevOps Basics**:  
   - **Deploying Apps**: Deployed several web applications to platforms like Heroku and Vercel, practicing CI/CD principles and learning the basics of containerization with Docker.
   - **AWS Basics**: Gained experience deploying static websites using AWS S3 and setting up a simple backend using AWS Lambda.

## Goals

The main goals of this repository are:

- To showcase my journey and progress in learning fullstack development.
- To demonstrate my ability to create complete, functional web applications using various technologies.
- To serve as a reference for myself and others who want to understand the steps of building fullstack projects.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js.
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express, REST APIs.
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite.
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub, Docker, AWS, Heroku, Vercel.

## Installation
To run any of the projects, make sure you have Node.js installed. Clone the repository and use a package manager like npm or yarn to install dependencies:

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/username/fullstack-learning-projects.git
cd fullstack-learning-projects

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage
Each folder contains a separate project or set of exercises. Navigate to the relevant folder and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within each folder if available.

To start a Node.js server for any back-end projects, use:

```sh
# Start the server
npm start
```

For front-end projects, simply open the HTML files in your browser or use a local development server like Live Server in VSCode.

## Future Plans
- Deepen my understanding of TypeScript for both front-end and back-end projects.
- Build a project with Next.js to explore server-side rendering.
- Gain more experience with GraphQL.
- Start exploring mobile development with React Native.
